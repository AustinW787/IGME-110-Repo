# RIT ARG Project

## 1. Executive Summary (Overview)

Imagine spending four hours wrestling with Duo Security just to log into your RIT account, feeling like you’re trying to crack the Da Vinci Code with 200 years of experience of being Conan in real life. You finally get in, and what do you see? A long list of overdue assignments!!!  When you click to view it,  a large line of letters appears:

ARG - A RIT GUFFAW

### Product Proposal: Social ARG Website for RIT Students
Our product is a social ARG (Alternate Reality Game) website designed to foster connections among RIT students. This platform will feature special missions and puzzles that encourage students to explore RIT’s vast campus and collaborate to solve mysteries, building a stronger sense of community in the process.

### Target Audience and Purpose
Our primary audience is RIT students who may find it challenging to engage with the broader campus community. By bringing together students from different majors, our ARG aims to break down social barriers. Through collaborative gameplay, we believe that our platform will help them discover like-minded peers who share an interest in games and technology.

### Promoting Campus Exploration
Our mission is to give students a compelling “reason” to explore these hidden gems together. With this in mind, our project’s core ideology is “Disconnect to Connect”—encouraging students to step away from the virtual world to forge real-life connections.

### Key Features and Inspiration
One of the standout elements of our ARG is its strong integration with the RIT campus itself.  Locations such as buildings, lab rooms, and the iconic tunnel system will play key roles in shaping the game’s style and mechanics. The puzzles and missions are inspired by the unique characteristics of RIT’s environment like looking for a hidden code inside the tiger’s mouth, counting the total number of stairs, or talking with a special professor to get a mission. 

Additionally, we’ve drawn inspiration from existing RIT websites and apps to create hidden interactions that enhance our gameplay. A compelling, immersive storyline will be integrated into the experience, ensuring players stay engaged throughout the long-term process of completing the game. The driving force behind the game’s appeal is the curiosity surrounding the ultimate answer to the final question.

## 2. Market Research and Need Analysis

### Existing ARGs
There are many ARGs, both large and small, that have seen great success over the years. RIT even had its own ARG back in 2009, Picture the Impossible, that required students to interact with different staff and go to downtown Rochester for certain elements (Wikipedia, 2024). However, that is where we see an issue. RIT has not had a multimedia project like an ARG since then with the same goal of bringing the community together. Even finding sources on it proved difficult, as the article posted by Democrat & Chronicle just exists as an

Also, technology has changed and developed so much over the years, including people's values and goals, that a new and fresh approach to student connectedness through a digital product like this could see great response. For instance, Plunkett’s Games, Apps & Social Media Industry Almanac from 2022 charts the statistics of  internet usage in the U.S. in 2020, and 99% of those 18-29 years old reportedly used the internet (33). Thus, with the internet and social media as popular as they are nowadays, especially for campaigning and branding, promoting projects like this one and getting people involved can be approached in a whole new way. 

### Evidence
In the publication “Alternate Reality Games and the Cusp of Digital Gameplay” by Antero Garcia and Greg Niemeyer, they mention the exact goal in mind with this project: “ARGs  involve players in more participatory and robust mapping practices… a more constructive way of forming creative connections… also [individuals] attach themselves to the real world by recruiting existing communications networks and digital technologies… and rejuvenating them through playful orientations that are invested in altering social life” (36). In this same work, ARGs are also defined as “a very specific and well-defined form of interactive transmedia storytelling” (187). The reason this is important is because ARGs are transmedia social games, and various sources – including a LinkedIn analysis – say the projected growth of the social game market is 15-16% in the next 7-8 years. The market is said to be valued currently at around $27-31.5 billion (from 2023 and 2024), and with the projected growth is estimated to reach anywhere from $70-90 billion in value in the market.

## 3. Product Description

### Core Feature
The core feature is the ARG’s website, as it will act as a hub of sorts for the main story. For the other puzzles, they will be either connected to or directly a part of this site, and any digital solution will have to go through it. Despite this, it will try to remain as immersive as possible, sticking to the story being told and playing itself off as a real site.

Other important features are the puzzles themselves. While we will not share the specifics of each puzzle due to the mystery required for an ARG to engage its players, we will have a combination of geolocation-based puzzles and solution throughout RIT’s academic buildings and tunnel systems, numerical ciphers, clues hidden in a video, and a fake RIT log-in screen. Part of the implementation of these puzzles includes ensuring that there will be no ‘false negatives’, meaning there will be clear indications that progress has been made.

### User Experience (UX)
By using both digital and physical tools, we meet the needs of lonely students by encouraging collaboration and exploration in a fun and engaging way that allows them to interact with RIT as a whole. The UX is essentially designed for this, as the ARG genre is very heavy on the experience of solving one. It is meant to be collaborative, and due to the variety of skills required to solve one, it is often extremely difficult, if not impossible, to figure it out alone. We plan on ours being the same, and due to our audience, we are focusing on the collaboration between students of different majors in particular.

### User Interface (UI)
As for the UI, a key part of making an ARG is making it immersive. UI is thus a very important part of this. Immersion can make it easier to work with other students, as everyone is immersed enough to dedicate themselves to accomplishing the greater goal rather than interpersonal anxieties. 
As a result, the looks and aesthetics of its parts may differ based on its role in the story. For example, some parts, such as the fake log-in screen, may appear more professionally, while others may appear under the guise of fellow students, which would be more casual. Having a mix of these roles allows for a more realistic, and thus immersive, story to play out.

### What Sets Us Apart
This project’s goal of bringing an experience unique to modern RIT students sets us apart most from others in the market. Technology is a large part of students’ lives here, especially for our audience of CS students, and this game reflects that greatly. Yet, by including in-person gameplay, it also encourages real world exploration and interaction that ties in with the sense of community on RIT campus.

## 4. Possible Problems and Counterarguments

### Community Interactions
Some of the possible arguments that can be made about the purpose of our ARG is if it will actually get people together and work together rather than being able to solve it only by yourself. We have nothing against people going solo, but promoting collaboration is the main goal of the ARG.  In order to increase collaboration, we plan to take puzzles from many subjects that (hopefully) no one person can solve by themselves.  There will be many pieces of this puzzle around campus, and people will have to be able to put all the pieces together that are found by many others.

### Mapping and Locations
Another argument could be about getting mapping information for our ARG. It is out of the scope for us to create our own GPS for this project, so we will be resorting to potential image hints/clues or latitude/longitude coordinates that you will have to find and then go there. 

### Set-up and Scope
The technical challenges that could arise is not having enough time to get everything up and running. We will keep within the scope in order to make sure this isn’t an issue, not being too ambitious. There could also be challenges when setting everything up at their respected locations without people necessarily knowing what it is for until they start solving our ARG. We will try to be as stealthy as we can about hiding information. Planned hidden information behind puzzles will be future-proofed to work for as long as possible  for future RIT Tigers and nothing important to solving the ARG will go missing. 

### Difficulty
We do also need to account for the difficulty itself, as we wouldn’t want it too easy while not insanely difficult where people would stop.  To solve this, we will test each other with the puzzles for the ARG that we plan to incorporate.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

Students are a talented, intelligent, and diverse group. However, for better or worse, most students struggle with making connections/finding people in the greater RIT community to interact with. Our ARG is designed with the specific intent to bring people together that normally would not interact with one another. Its steps need people to move around campus, talk with others from other dorms, get knowledge from third-parties, and solve the puzzle.

Not to mention that RIT has a history with ARGs! In 2009, one of our very own professors helped run an ARG for the university! We want to use this as an opportunity to improve and expand on the ideas of our predecessors and continue this longerstand tradition. Our ARG may only run once, but the framework we create should help those who come after. 

RIT has a huge CS population, this ARG is both pandering to that population while also bridging the gap with the help of other majors. Most Majors will most likely never interact with certain parts of RIT, we hope to remedy that and allow them to have a greater understanding of campus. We believe that this Website can be a mainstay for incoming freshmen to make friends at RIT.
